READ ME:
This is my A Level course work for AQA computer science. This was in the years 2018-2020 but due to Coronavirus the coursework was cancelled.
This is used for an EXAMPLE as a project idea or solving a problem. You cannot copy or change my code and to be submitted for following years.
You must follow and keep in line with any exam boards rules and requirements when it comes to coursework.
If you want to use the programme and only the programme to teach then you can copy and change so you can teach other students.
If you want to use my code as an example to teach then contact me because I've probably left some really dumb comment or code.

About the project:
The project took about 300 hours. 75 hours coding, 150 hours researching, 75 hours documentation.
The researching time is so high due to completely redoing the project due to learning new tricks and feeling the need to find complicated techniques so that I can
reach the higher marks.
I choose C# and WPF due to prior experience with the language and honestly I think it's the best thing out there for A level coursework.
I got it marked before it got cancelled and got 76/80 but then improved in the area where I was missing the marks and got 80/80.
This is why I've added the all the documentation so that you can see how it's laid out. It show how it doesn't need to be pretty or include everything to 
get all the marks.

This project was entirely created by Andrew Foot
